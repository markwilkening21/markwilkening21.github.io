## Project Proposal - January 28, 2026

I wish to build a base of skills in Linux System Administration. Using the Linux Foundation training tools, I plan to engage in weekly learning sessions that will ultimately lead to a Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) cerftification after taking the exam. 

I want to expand my skillset to contribute to my hirability and help in my job search. I think understanding Linux on this level will be useful whether I become a System Admin or not. I’ve always been interested in this topic, I’d now like to seriously increase my understanding of it.

* Some of the topics covered in this course:
* Linux Filesystem Tree Layout
* User Environment
* User Account Management
* Group Management
* File Permissions and Ownership
* Package Management Systems
* dpkg, APT, RPM, dnf, yum, zypper
* GIT Fundamentals
* Processes and Process Monitoring
* Memory Monitoring, Usage and Configuring Swap

The course estimates 50-60 hours worth of learning material is available. This is just beyond the 45 hours allotted for the project, so I understand I may not complete 100% of the materials by the end of the semester. I will try to cover 2 chapters each week, as there are 34 chapters in the course. As long as I spend 3-5 hours a week on this material, I will have a much greater understanding of the material at the end of the semester and should be close to completing the course and preparing for the certification exam. The course costs $299. 

## Week 2 Update - January 20-26, 2025

Last week I spent time brainstorming about semester project ideas. As I've been slowly applying for jobs for the past year without success, I wanted to work on something for my resume that was concrete with a definitive line item, rather than just putting "C++" under "Languages" which can obviously be pretty dynamic as to someone's level. I've been interested in Linux/SysAdmin for awhile and started poking around linuxfoundation.org and am considering working toward a [LFCS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/linux-system-administration-essentials-lfs207/) (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator). I also spent time reading and watching tutorials on Jekyll to start building my personal site for this class.

This week I'm going to spend some time exploring other ideas for a semester project, possibly furthering my knowledge of Python or C++ on Leetcode or Exercism.

I'm currently not blocked in any way.

I think my process will fall into form more specifically after I choose a project.
