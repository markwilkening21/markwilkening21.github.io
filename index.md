## Week 2 Update - January 20-26, 2025

Last week I spent time brainstorming about semester project ideas. As I've been slowly applying for jobs for the past year without success, I wanted to work on something for my resume that was concrete with a definitive line item, rather than just putting "C++" under "Languages" which can obviously be pretty dynamic as to someone's level. I've been interested in Linux/SysAdmin for awhile and started poking around linuxfoundation.org and am considering working toward a LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator). I also spent time reading and watching tutorials on Jekyll to start building my personal site for this class.

This week I'm going to spend some time exploring other ideas for a semester project, possibly furthering my knowledge of Python or C++ on Leetcode or Exercism.


I'm currently not blocked in any way.

I think my process will fall into form more specifically after I choose a project.
