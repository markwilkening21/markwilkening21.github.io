## Week 5 Update - February 10 - February 16, 2025

This week I completed sections/modules on Group Management, File Permissions, and Ownership in a Linux system. I learned to 
* add new users
* modify their passwords 
* add them and remove them from groups 
* login to their accounts remotely
* set ownership of files or directories to groups
* modify file permissions using chmod
* understand octal shorthand of permissions
* use chown and chgrp to change file ownership or group ownership
* use umask (user file creation mask) to set default file and directory permissions when new files are created

I read Chapter 3, Access Control and Rootly Powers, in the UNIX/Linux book I mentioned last week. 

Next I will be working on Modules about Package Management Systems, DPKG, and APT.

I'm moving at a good pace, I really enjoy the format of the modules and I love messing around in Ubuntu using a VM. No blockers.


## Week 4 Update - February 3 - February 9, 2025

This week I started reading _The Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook_. I had heard of this book spoken of very highly, but didn't realize the very strong UCB connection until I started it. The opening has a tribute to [Evi Nemeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evi_Nemeth), who was a Computer Science professor at UCB.

Anyway, I read the first 2 chapters which included an introductory chapter on the roles of a system administrator, and a chapter on Booting and System Management Daemons. 

In the LFS207 Module, I completed chapters on User Environment (Ch 3) and User Account Management (Ch 4).

This week I will move on to Chapters 5 (Group Management) and 6 (File Permissions) in LFS207, and I'll start reading Chapter 3 in the Unix/Linux Book.

I'm not blocked, and I'm getting into a routine of knocking out a little at a time in 30-60 minutes increments.


## Week 3 Update - January 27 - February 2, 2025

This week I wrote my project proposal and officially decided to start working on the Linux Foundation System Administration course. I signed up and paid for the course, and started watching and reading the introductory material. I learned about the basic differences between Linux distributions and setup a virtual machine in case there are specific differences between my personal machine (running pop_os) and the instructions in Ubuntu, centOS, or openSUSE. I chose to setup a VM with Ubuntu because I already have experience working with it and know how to set it up. I read/watched the Intro content which I was already familiar with and setup my PATH in .bashrc to search **sbin** when doing a normal system search to find system utilities. I completed the chapter on the Linux Filesystem Tree Layout, which details how files are organized on a Linux system. It then breaks down what is contained in each of the ~18 system directories, from /bin to /run. 

Next week I will work my way through chapters on the User Environment and User Account Management. Splitting the time up in management chunks is very helpful for me rather than knocking out 3 hours on a Saturday. As long as my schedule allows, I will continue to use this method.

## Project Proposal - January 28, 2026

I wish to build a base of skills in Linux System Administration. Using the Linux Foundation training tools, I plan to engage in weekly learning sessions that will ultimately lead to a Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) cerftification after taking the exam. 

I want to expand my skillset to contribute to my hirability and help in my job search. I think understanding Linux on this level will be useful whether I become a System Admin or not. I’ve always been interested in this topic, I’d now like to seriously increase my understanding of it.

* Some of the topics covered in this course:
* Linux Filesystem Tree Layout
* User Environment
* User Account Management
* Group Management
* File Permissions and Ownership
* Package Management Systems
* dpkg, APT, RPM, dnf, yum, zypper
* GIT Fundamentals
* Processes and Process Monitoring
* Memory Monitoring, Usage and Configuring Swap

The course estimates 50-60 hours worth of learning material is available. This is just beyond the 45 hours allotted for the project, so I understand I may not complete 100% of the materials by the end of the semester. I will try to cover 2 chapters each week, as there are 34 chapters in the course. As long as I spend 3-5 hours a week on this material, I will have a much greater understanding of the material at the end of the semester and should be close to completing the course and preparing for the certification exam. The course costs $299. 

## Week 2 Update - January 20-26, 2025

Last week I spent time brainstorming about semester project ideas. As I've been slowly applying for jobs for the past year without success, I wanted to work on something for my resume that was concrete with a definitive line item, rather than just putting "C++" under "Languages" which can obviously be pretty dynamic as to someone's level. I've been interested in Linux/SysAdmin for awhile and started poking around linuxfoundation.org and am considering working toward a [LFCS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/linux-system-administration-essentials-lfs207/) (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator). I also spent time reading and watching tutorials on Jekyll to start building my personal site for this class.

This week I'm going to spend some time exploring other ideas for a semester project, possibly furthering my knowledge of Python or C++ on Leetcode or Exercism.

I'm currently not blocked in any way.

I think my process will fall into form more specifically after I choose a project.
